You are continuing work on the Spendful mobile app.

Your task is to implement THREE focused upgrades:
1) More engaging (but still calm) UX
2) Support for multiple spend entries per day
3) Richer Weekly and Monthly statistics

Do NOT add any other features.
Do NOT turn Spendful into a budgeting app.

────────────────────────
CORE PRODUCT RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE)
────────────────────────
• Spendful is an awareness app, not a budget
• Calm, reflective tone
• No guilt, no warnings, no goals
• No flashy animations or aggressive colors
• Insight > control

────────────────────────
UPGRADE #1 — MORE ENGAGING UX (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────

Improve engagement WITHOUT adding complexity.

Allowed UX improvements:
- Subtle card layouts
- Better visual hierarchy
- Gentle transitions (fade / slide)
- Icons used sparingly (not decorative)
- Better empty states
- Typography contrast (titles vs body)

NOT allowed:
❌ Gamification
❌ Streaks
❌ Confetti / fireworks
❌ Red vs green spend indicators
❌ Loud charts

Focus on:
- Daily Prompt
- Weekly Summary
- Monthly Overview

The app should feel thoughtful, not sterile.

────────────────────────
UPGRADE #2 — MULTIPLE ENTRIES PER DAY (CRITICAL)
────────────────────────

Users must be able to log MULTIPLE spend entries in a single day.

Rules:
- A single day can have:
  - Zero entries
  - One entry
  - Multiple entries
- Each entry includes:
  - amount (required)
  - category (optional)
  - note (optional)
  - timestamp (local time)

Database changes:
- Replace the “one log per day” assumption
- Each spend entry must be its own row
- Add:
  - entry_id (UUID)
  - entry_timestamp (epoch ms)
- Day grouping must still be based on local date (YYYY-MM-DD)

UX behavior:
- Daily Prompt shows:
  - “Add spend” button
  - List of today’s entries (calm list)
- Users can:
  - Add multiple entries
  - Edit entries within allowed range
  - Delete individual entries

This must remain fast and low-friction.

────────────────────────
UPGRADE #3 — RICHER WEEKLY & MONTHLY STATISTICS
────────────────────────

Enhance insights while staying calm and non-judgmental.

Weekly view should show:
- Total spend
- Number of entries
- Number of spend days
- Average spend per day (only days with spend)
- Top 2 categories (by amount)

Monthly view should show:
- Total spend
- Average daily spend (spend days only)
- Highest spend day (date + amount)
- Lowest spend day (non-zero)
- Top 3 categories
- Spend frequency (e.g. “18 of 30 days had spending”)

UX rules:
- Stats must be secondary to the calendar
- Use cards or sections, not charts with axes
- No comparisons to previous periods
- No “you spent more than” language
- No trend arrows

────────────────────────
PAYWALL & ENTITLEMENTS (DO NOT BREAK)
────────────────────────

Free users:
- Can add unlimited entries
- Can view/edit ONLY last 14 days

Paid users:
- Full access

If free users try to view or edit beyond limit:
- Show paywall
- Do NOT block the entire screen

────────────────────────
FILES LIKELY INVOLVED
────────────────────────
- DailyPrompt.tsx
- WeeklySummary.tsx
- MonthlyOverview.tsx
- dailyLogs.service.ts (or equivalent)
- SQLite migration files
- UI components (cards, lists)

Modify ONLY what is required.

────────────────────────
WHAT NOT TO DO
────────────────────────
❌ Do NOT add budgets
❌ Do NOT add charts with axes
❌ Do NOT add goals or savings targets
❌ Do NOT add streaks
❌ Do NOT add notifications based on spending
❌ Do NOT auto-categorize

────────────────────────
DEFINITION OF DONE
────────────────────────
- UX feels more alive but still calm
- Users can log multiple entries per day
- Weekly & Monthly views provide richer insight
- App remains simple and non-judgmental
- No data loss
- No crashes
- Paywall still works correctly

Complete ONLY these changes.

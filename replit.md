# Spendful - Daily Spend Awareness App

## Overview

Spendful is a calm, minimal daily spend awareness mobile application built with Expo (React Native). It's deliberately NOT a budgeting app - instead, it focuses on mindful awareness through a single daily question: "Did you spend money today?"

The app follows an ethical, non-manipulative design philosophy with a calm, non-judgmental tone throughout. It's designed to be offline-first with local SQLite storage, no authentication required, and minimal external dependencies.

**Key Features:**
- Single daily action: log whether you spent money
- Weekly and monthly spend awareness summaries
- Optional daily reminder notifications
- Freemium model with 14-day free history access
- Cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Web)

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Expo SDK 54 with React Native 0.81
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Navigation**: Stack-only navigation using React Navigation Native Stack (no tabs or drawer)
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for async data, React useState for local state
- **Animations**: React Native Reanimated for smooth, spring-based animations
- **Styling**: React Native StyleSheet with a centralized theme system (Colors, Spacing, Typography)

### Navigation Flow
Linear stack navigation from onboarding to daily prompt:
1. Onboarding (4-screen intro sequence)
2. Daily Prompt (main/home screen)
3. Weekly Summary (accessible from Daily Prompt)
4. Monthly Overview (accessible from Daily Prompt)
5. Paywall (modal for premium features)
6. Settings (app configuration)

### Data Storage
- **Local Storage**: AsyncStorage for offline-first data persistence (cross-platform: web, iOS, Android)
- **Data Models**:
  - `spend_entries`: Stores individual spending entries (entry_id, date, amount, category, note, timestamp) - supports multiple entries per day
  - `app_settings`: Configuration (reminder time, notifications, free history days, onboarding status)
  - `subscriptions`: Subscription status tracking
- **Data Migration**: Automatic v1→v2 migration converts legacy daily_logs to new spend_entries format on first load
- **Note**: Changed from expo-sqlite to AsyncStorage because expo-sqlite doesn't bundle on web platform. AsyncStorage works on all platforms and is sufficient for this app's simple data model.

### Backend Architecture
- **Server**: Express.js server for web deployment and API endpoints
- **Database (Server)**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for server-side data (configured but minimal usage since app is offline-first)
- **Purpose**: Primarily serves the landing page and handles web deployment; the mobile app operates independently with local SQLite

### Path Aliases
- `@/` → `./client/`
- `@shared/` → `./shared/`

### Component Architecture
- Reusable themed components: `ThemedView`, `ThemedText`, `Button`, `Card`
- Error boundary with fallback UI
- Keyboard-aware scroll view with cross-platform compatibility
- Custom hooks for theme, screen options, and color scheme

## External Dependencies

### Core Mobile Dependencies
- **@react-native-async-storage/async-storage**: Local storage for offline-first data persistence (cross-platform)
- **expo-notifications**: Daily reminder notifications
- **@react-navigation/native-stack**: Stack-based navigation
- **react-native-reanimated**: Animation library
- **react-native-gesture-handler**: Touch gesture handling
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Data fetching and caching

### Server Dependencies
- **express**: Web server framework
- **pg**: PostgreSQL client for server-side database
- **drizzle-orm**: TypeScript ORM for database operations
- **http-proxy-middleware**: Development proxy for Expo bundler

### In-App Purchases (Planned)
- Apple IAP and Google Play Billing integration planned for premium features
- Currently stubbed/mocked in PaywallScreen

### Build & Development
- **expo**: Core Expo SDK and tooling
- **expo-dev-client**: Development builds for native iOS/Android
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for server
- **drizzle-kit**: Database migration tooling

## Native Build Setup

Spendful uses **Expo Development Builds** instead of Expo Go for production-ready native iOS and Android apps.

### Directory Structure
- `ios/` - Native iOS Xcode project (generated by prebuild)
- `android/` - Native Android Gradle project (generated by prebuild)
- `eas.json` - EAS Build configuration for development, preview, and production builds

### Building the App

**Development Build (for local testing):**
```bash
# iOS Simulator
npx expo run:ios

# Android Emulator
npx expo run:android
```

**EAS Cloud Builds:**
```bash
# Install EAS CLI globally
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo account
eas login

# Development build (internal distribution)
eas build --profile development --platform ios
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Preview build (internal testing)
eas build --profile preview --platform all

# Production build (store distribution)
eas build --profile production --platform all
```

### Regenerating Native Folders

If you need to regenerate native folders after changing plugins or dependencies:
```bash
EXPO_NO_GIT_STATUS=1 npx expo prebuild --clean --no-install
```

### Bundle Identifiers
- iOS: `com.spendful.app`
- Android: `com.spendful.app`

**Note:** Do not change bundle identifiers after initial setup unless explicitly required.
